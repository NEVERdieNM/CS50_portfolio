                  This was the first time I wrote a programm in Python except for when I first installed the Python intepreter and wrote a <b>"Hello, World!"</b> programm. <br>
                  I got the inspiration for this project from a Youtube short which showcased how you can use the <b>fernet module</b> from the Python <b>cryptography library</b> to encrypt/decrypt a certain file. <br>
                  I tried it myself, and then decided I want to bring it a step further and also use that as an opportunity to get more familiar with Python. <br>
                  What I thought about adding was <b>recursivity</b>, so that is what I decided to add along with some features to make it more <b>user friendly</b> and <b>"safe"</b> in the sense that I implement some sort of <b>failsafe</b> or <b>warning</b> the user gets if for example the user tries to encrypt a file that has already been encrypted, since that would make it impossible to decrypt if the user didn't save the key of the previous encryption.

                  There are two programms, <b>Encrypt.py</b> and <b>Decrypt.py</b>. <br>
                  <b>Encrypt.py</b> goes through all files and directories inside the directory in which the programm was executed and first checks if they have already been encrypted, if it finds a file that has already been encrypted it warns the user and asks if the program should continue execution. <br>
                  It then lists all files that will be encrypted, if there are files that fail to encrypt, it also lists those files. <br>
                  After the encryption it creates a <b>key.txt</b> file in which the key used to encrypt the files is stored. <br>
                  <b>Decrypt.py</b> first reads the <b>key.txt</b> file, if it doesn't exist it notifies the user and stop execustion. <br>
                  If key.txt was found it goes through all files and directories inside the directory in which the programm was executed and recursively decrypts all files. <br>
                  It then prints all decrypted files, and all files that failed to decrypt or have been ecncrypted more than once (if there are any).

                    I learned a lot more from this project but another thing I learned and find interesting is the <b>world coordinate system</b> and the <b>screen coordinate system</b>, I learned how to convert the world coordinates into screen coordinates and used that to create a camera effect that follows the player character. <br>
                    This also helped calculate what objects from the world coordinate system will appear on screen and then only draw the ones that do appear on screen, this doesn't make a big difference in this little game, but it is a good habit to optimize your game
